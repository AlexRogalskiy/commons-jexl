Jexl 3.0 uses Maven 3 as the build tool, and requires Java 6 (or later).

The following goals may be useful:
* mvn clean - clean up
* mvn test - compile and run the unit tests
* mvn site - create the documentation
* mvn package - build the jar
* mvn install - build the jar and install in local maven repository
