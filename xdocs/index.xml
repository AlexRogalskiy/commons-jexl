    <section name="Jexl : Java Expression Language">

    <p>
    Jexl is an expression language engine designed for easy embedding in
    applications and frameworks.  It implements an extended version of the
    Expression Language of the JSTL.
    </p>

    <p>
    The motivation was to bring some of the lessons learned by the Velocity
    community about expersssion languages in templating to a wider audience.
    And I just had to get Velocity-ish method access in Jelly.  Just had to.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is an example of using Jexl :
    </p>

    <source>
    <![CDATA[
        /*
         *  create an expression object
         */
        Expression e = ExpressionFactory.createExpression("foo.innerFoo.bar()");

        /*
         *  create a context and add data
         */
        JexlContext jc = JexlHelper.createContext();
        jc.getVars().put("foo", new Foo() );

        /*
         *  now evaluate the expression, getting the result
        Object o = e.evaluate(jc);
    ]]>
    </source>

    <p>
    Jexl has extended the JSTL in a few ways :
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Support for invocation of any accessible method (see example above).
        </li>
        <li>
        Added a general size() method, which works on String, returning length,
        Map, returning # of keys, and List and arrays, returning the
        number of elements.
        </li>
        <li>
        Optional syntax for the 'empty' function :   empty(obj)
        </li>
        <li>
        Misc : '+' has been overloaded to be use as a String concatenation operator
        </li>

     </ul>
